AI Chatbot ðŸ¤–
This is an AI-powered chatbot built using Streamlit, FastAPI, Uvicorn, LangChain, OpenAI API, Groq API, and Tavily Search.
The chatbot allows users to interact with AI agents, define specific roles, and query models like Llama 3-8B with real-time search capabilities.

ðŸš€ Features
Role-based AI Agents: Define the AIâ€™s role (e.g., compiler construction teacher, stock market analyst, etc.).
Multiple Providers: Supports OpenAI and Groq APIs.
Real-time Search: Uses Tavily Search to enhance responses.
FastAPI Backend: Provides a scalable API with Uvicorn.
Streamlit UI: Intuitive and minimalistic frontend.
Supports Llama 3: Runs models like llama-3-8b-70b-versatile.

ðŸŒŸ How It Works
Define the agentâ€™s role (e.g., "Act as a compiler construction teacher").
Choose a model provider (OpenAI or Groq).
Enter your query.
The chatbot responds based on predefined AI roles.
